-Overall Time of Usage Per Ride
This graphic shows the time peak of usage per ride is between 5-10 minutes, afterwards it tapers off and almost hits a flat line around 40 minutes. 
-When are the Bikes Being Used the Most 
--Bikes are being used 

## 3. SUMMARY

- One major drawback to the design is that when you select a date, city, etc. you do not know if it will match with any of the data in the table. It is unknown to the user if what input will return a filtered output.
- Additional Recommendations
  1) Add dropdowns to each of the categories to help show what dates, cities, etc. are available to search based on the data provided
  2) Create a button to clear filters instead of having to delete the data in the box manually or refresh the page
