- Filtering can be done by typing a specific criteria into the filter data boxes, see this image with data filtered for 1.10.2010

- Filtering can also be done on multiple criteria at the same time. This image displays data that is for 1.10.2010 and was reported in the state of Massachussetts

## 3. SUMMARY

- One major drawback to the design is that when you select a date, city, etc. you do not know if it will match with any of the data in the table. It is unknown to the user if what input will return a filtered output.
- Additional Recommendations
  1) Add dropdowns to each of the categories to help show what dates, cities, etc. are available to search based on the data provided
  2) Create a button to clear filters instead of having to delete the data in the box manually or refresh the page
