# NYC Citibike Analysis

## 1. OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
The task of this challenge was to create data visualization of the CitiBike ride service that is in New York City in order to provide information to decision makers in Des Moines, IA to assess the feasibility of a similar service in their city.

## 2. RESULTS

-Please review the Tableau story in the following link:

- Overall Time of Usage Per Ride:
This graphic shows the time peak of usage per ride is between 5-10 minutes, afterwards it tapers off and almost hits a flat line around 40 minutes.

- When are the Bikes Being Used the Most: 
Bikes are mostly being used during work days in the commute rush hours 7-9 am and 5-7pm. On the weekends this is most concentrated during daytime hours.
- Overall Gender Usage Breakdown:
We see here that the majority by 2/3rds are male.
- Time Usage by Gender:
None of the genders use the bikes longer than the others
- Differences in When Bikes are used by Gender
Weekly usage patterns are same regardless of gender
- Subscriber Breakdown and Daily Usage
We see here that Male users are more strongly subscribers than women and they tend to use more consistently. Non-subscriber customer users are the same across all the genders but it is a much smaller user base. NYC residents use the bikes at a much higher rate than tourists.
- Number of Rides per bike
This shows that there is a wide variety in the usage of each individual price and the cost of maintenance should be considered when evaluating a proposal for this adaptation into a city.

## 3. SUMMARY

- Looking through the NYC Citibike data there are strong weekly patterns in usage and it is driven by a 2/3rds male majority of users. If the city of Des Moines belives that the male population would be eager to adopt this into their weekly transportation then it would be worth further investigating and cost analysis.
- Additional Visualization Recommendations
  1) Average weekly revenue per subscriber and gender
  2) Average length of trip per bike to see if the number of trips taken is consistent with the distance traveled
